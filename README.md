*   **Analyze Revenue by Category:** Understand the contribution of Luxury and Business categories.
*   **Monitor RevPar, ADR, and Occupancy % by Month and Week:**  Observe trends over time and identify seasonal patterns.
*   **Filter Data:** Analyze the data based on city and room type.
*   **Examine Detailed Property Performance:** View granular performance data for individual properties.
